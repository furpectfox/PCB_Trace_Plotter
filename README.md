# Pen Plotter Attachment
This 3D-printed pen plotter is designed to be mounted on the spindle motor of a CNC 3018 machine. Once mounted, it enables the CNC machine to draw traces on a copper-clad board using a permanent marker. When placing the copper-clad board into an etching solution, the exposed copper is etched away, leaving the drawn copper traces intact and forming the PCB.
